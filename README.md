# Title - Solar System Visualization

## This is a mini project for the Visualization of Solar System built using Turtle

Visualizing the solar system using the turtle module in Python can be a fun and interactive way to learn about the planets and their relative positions.
To start, you would import the turtle module and create a turtle object. 
Then, you would set the background to your color of choice and create a loop that iterates through each planet. For each planet,
you would set the turtle's position to the planet's coordinates and draw a circle for the planet using the turtle's dot() method.
You could also add labels for the planet's name and adjust the size of the circle based on the planet's size. Additionally,
you could also draw lines to represent the orbits of the planets. 
This simple visualization can be a great way to explore the solar system and gain a better understanding of the relative positions of the planets.
